	"I'm just saying.  <i>The Sims</i> is slavery."
	[then]
	My housemate, Kali, was on again about her thesis.  I'm never really sure if she means it or
	if she's just trolling her committee.
	[then]
	We're both grad students at UC Grover's Mill.  She works in Philosophy, I work in game AI.
	We're on a late night run to the local Taco King.
	
	It's 1am.  It's Grover's Mill.  Options are limited.
	
	Finances too.

	"Characters are people, my girl.  Just like corporations."

	"Corporations are persons under the law," I said.  "They're not <i>ethical</i> persons."

	"Well, that's certainly true about F---Book.  But corporations and characters are both social inventions.
	Why should one have more rights than the other?"

	"I'm pretty sure there's a fictional mouse that has more rights than I do."

	"That's just the corporation that has those rights.  Mr. Mouse is a just a slave.
	They probably keep him in chained in the basement when he's off the clock."
	[then]
	Kali reached the top of the hill.  She stopped.  "Weird."
	[then]
	I caught up with her.  "What?"  I followed her gaze.  "They're dark.  Taco King is never dark."

	"Power failure?" She looked skeptical, even as she said it.

	"Street lights are on.  How badly do you have to [FuckUp] to bankrupt the only late night
	restaurant in a college town?"

FuckUp: fuck up
